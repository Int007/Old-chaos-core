# The purpose of this file is mainly
# gather up info about what has to be
# done and share it with the current
# repo collabs instead of making
# particular issue treads.
#
# 1)Instance Enviorement
# A) Icecrown Citadel:
# - Find out wy sometimes sindragosa
# event wont start. My guess is that
# valithria encounter is never finished
# due to some trigger staying in combat
# since DBM keep chronometrating encounter
# timers even after she's defeated.
# 
# - Find out wy saurfang's bloodbeasts
# aren't giving him blood power. The beasts
# gains the blood link when they are summoned
# but 1 sec before, it dissapears.
#
# - Blood queen's lana'thel bloodbolt problem
# has already been reported and assigned to shauren
# on tc. So lets just wait.
#
# B) Ruby Sanctum:
# - Halion's corporeality doesn't work
# - Raise respawn time of trashes
#
# C) Halls of Reflection:
# - Fix spirit wave's fast spawning issue after the 
# first boss is defeated.
#
# D) Dungeon Finder:
# - Fix proper encounter quest credit when killing the
# last bosses on CoS and DTK. (Greymane is already assigned)
#
# E) Ulduar:
# - Find out what broke algalon's cosmic smash.
#
# 2) Spell Enviorement (This have a long list but i'll just put the most ugly ones)
# 
# A) Warrior's bladestorm: 
# - It's broken, the warrior can be slowed,
# Mind controlled, hexed, and cycloned while he's casting it,
# the slow problem can be fixed by porting old dr tenmas patch
# into chaoscore http://tinyurl.com/3hps4au and the others ones can be
# simply solved using spell_linked_spell table
#
# B) Rogue's Evenom + Relentless strikes
# - Rogue's envenom is granting double relentless strikes proc
# (maybe due to quaston's mess implementing new spell attributes? ¬¬')
#
# 3) Core-Battleground Enviorement 
#
# - Wintergrasp crash when end
# - 1x honor rate win 35-35k honor
# - Shadowsight tower bug - 2 stack tower control
#
#
# Any repo collab can feel free to change the list content or it's format
# if he found a better one :)
